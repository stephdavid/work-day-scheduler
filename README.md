### Acceptance Criteria

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page


### Process

* To begin, I have added the "Timeblocks" rows to the html page. While not required as the provided html and css is in bootstrap, I'll go with the flow. 😊 I've noted (rather VS Code has highlighted) that there are no labels for the elements <textarea> and <button>. The container flex doesn't work when I add them. Something to look into later.

* I have added today's date - but it's in a cryptic format. Something to ask about in class tonight.
